# Machine-Learning-Rainfall-Prediction-Models
Goal is to predict whether there will be rainfall in a specific day or not. Use a Kaggle dataset. Implement various machine learning algorithms and compare the model's accuracy - Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, kNN, Random Forest. Perform Lasso and Ridge regularization techniques to improve the models efficiency.
